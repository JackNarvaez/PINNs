# PINNs

An introduction to PINNs: Physics-Informed Neural Networks.

This repository is divided into three parts:
 
1. Perceptron: It provides a basic introduction to Neural Networks (NNs). In particular, it develops an elementary model of a Perceptron variation, i.e., a single neuron.

2. Backpropagation: It provides the Backpropagation method for a general Neural Network. In addition, it shows the maths behind this algorithm.

3. PINNs: It introduces a class of NNs called Physics-Informed Neural Networks. In particular, it addresses some EDO examples using PINNs, which are implemented via the FLUX package.
